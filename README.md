# Reserved Instance Checker

Simple Python script to check whether there is a shortfall or
over-provision in reserved instances.

To use, you need to set the environment variables:
 - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
 - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
 - EC2_REGION

NB - this script does not discriminate between light/medium/heavy
